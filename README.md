# MPESA LEDGER FLUTTER PROJECT

This is an MPESA ledger project that receives and listens to SMS from MPESA to create an analytical view of your MPESA transactions, that is, deposits and withdrawals all **stored in an SQLite Database in your phone, not anywhere else.** Other features include categorizing your transaction, calculating MPESA transactions fees and a year monthly summary

### Category Page

The following is the category page where you can see the default categories and a pie chart showing number of transactions for each category. You can also create our own category by simply adding a keyword Example below shows creating a category by the keywords (Airtime and Paybill) which later returns all transactions that have the keywords(Airtime and Paybill). Deleting a category is fairly easy by swipping left or right and confirming the deletion
